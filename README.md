# Book Collection RESTful API With NodeJS

Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for backend development.
When combined with express, we will create lightweight, fast, scalable APIs quickly and simply. 
We will walk through standing up a lightweight Express server serving truly RESTful services 
using Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

We will implement all of the RESTful verbs to get, add, and update data from our service.
We will also work through unit tests for our services.
